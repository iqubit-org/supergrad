# Multi-GPU Performance Analysis for SuperGrad

## Executive Summary

Based on my analysis of the SuperGrad codebase, I've identified several potential bottlenecks that are likely causing poor multi-GPU scaling (less than 2x speedup with 8 GPUs instead of the expected 4-5x). This document provides a systematic approach to diagnose and fix these issues.

## Potential Bottlenecks Identified

### 1. **Limited Sharding Strategy**
**Problem**: The current sharding implementation in `supergrad/utils/sharding.py` only supports basic partitioning along a single axis ('p'). This may not be optimal for quantum simulation workloads.

**Evidence**:
- Sharding is only applied to target unitaries and final outputs
- No sharding of intermediate computation steps
- Limited use of JAX's advanced sharding features

**Impact**: Poor load balancing across GPUs

### 2. **Serialization in Time Evolution**
**Problem**: The time evolution solver (`ode_expm`) in `supergrad/time_evolution/ode.py` may have serial dependencies that prevent effective parallelization.

**Evidence**:
- Uses `jax.lax.scan` for time stepping, which can create serial bottlenecks
- Matrix exponentiation operations may not be optimally distributed
- Custom VJP (Vector-Jacobian Product) implementation may have serial components

**Impact**: Time evolution becomes the bottleneck, limiting overall speedup

### 3. **Memory Transfer Overhead**
**Problem**: Frequent data transfers between devices during computation.

**Evidence**:
- Multiple basis transformations (product â†” eigen basis)
- Sharding operations that require data redistribution
- Potential unnecessary device transfers in the evolution pipeline

**Impact**: High communication overhead reduces effective speedup

### 4. **Inefficient JIT Compilation**
**Problem**: JIT compilation may not be optimized for multi-device execution.

**Evidence**:
- Some functions may not be properly JIT-compiled for multi-device
- Potential compilation overhead that doesn't scale well
- Custom VJP rules may not be optimized for distributed execution

**Impact**: Compilation and execution overhead

### 5. **Quantum System Initialization Bottleneck**
**Problem**: The quantum system initialization in `Evolve._init_quantum_system()` may be serial.

**Evidence**:
- Hamiltonian construction may not be parallelized
- Eigenvalue decomposition operations may be single-device
- Parameter sharing logic may create dependencies

**Impact**: Initialization time doesn't scale with device count

## Step-by-Step Analysis Plan

### Phase 1: Profiling and Bottleneck Identification (Week 1)

1. **Run the profiling script** (`benchmark/multi_gpu_profiling.py`)
   - Measure execution time for each component
   - Monitor GPU utilization across devices
   - Track memory usage and transfers

2. **Analyze scaling behavior**
   - Test with 1, 2, 4, 8 GPUs
   - Calculate speedup and efficiency
   - Identify which components scale poorly

3. **Use JAX profiling tools**
   ```python
   # Enable JAX profiling
   jax.profiler.start_trace("/tmp/jax-trace")
   # Run your computation
   jax.profiler.stop_trace()
   ```

### Phase 2: Component-Level Optimization (Week 2-3)

#### 2.1 Optimize Time Evolution
- **Investigate `ode_expm` parallelization**
  - Check if time steps can be parallelized
  - Optimize matrix exponentiation for multi-device
  - Consider alternative ODE solvers

- **Improve sharding in evolution**
  ```python
  # Example: Better sharding for evolution
  def improved_evolution_sharding(hamiltonian, psi_list):
      # Shard both Hamiltonian and states
      sharded_ham = jax.device_put(hamiltonian, get_sharding('p', None))
      sharded_psi = jax.device_put(psi_list, get_sharding('p', None))
      return evolve_with_sharding(sharded_ham, sharded_psi)
  ```

#### 2.2 Optimize Quantum System Initialization
- **Parallelize Hamiltonian construction**
- **Distribute eigenvalue computations**
- **Optimize parameter sharing logic**

#### 2.3 Improve Memory Management
- **Minimize device transfers**
- **Use in-place operations where possible**
- **Optimize sharding patterns**

### Phase 3: Advanced Optimizations (Week 4)

#### 3.1 Implement Better Sharding Strategies
```python
# Example: Multi-dimensional sharding
def advanced_sharding_strategy():
    devices = mesh_utils.create_device_mesh((2, 4))  # 2x4 grid
    mesh = Mesh(devices, ('batch', 'time'))
    return NamedSharding(mesh, PartitionSpec('batch', 'time'))
```

#### 3.2 Optimize Custom VJP Rules
- **Ensure VJP computations are parallelized**
- **Minimize serial dependencies in gradient computation**
- **Use efficient adjoint methods**

#### 3.3 Implement Pipeline Parallelism
- **Overlap computation and communication**
- **Use asynchronous operations**
- **Implement prefetching**

## Immediate Actions to Take

### 1. **Run Profiling Analysis**
```bash
cd benchmark
python multi_gpu_profiling.py
```

### 2. **Enable JAX Debugging**
```python
# Add to your script
jax.debug.visualize_array_sharding(your_array)
jax.debug.print("Device placement: {}", jax.devices())
```

### 3. **Test Different Sharding Patterns**
```python
# Test different sharding strategies
sharding_patterns = [
    get_sharding(None, 'p'),      # Current
    get_sharding('p', None),      # Alternative 1
    get_sharding('p', 'p'),       # Alternative 2
]
```

### 4. **Monitor GPU Utilization**
```python
# Use nvidia-smi or GPUtil to monitor
import GPUtil
gpus = GPUtil.getGPUs()
for gpu in gpus:
    print(f"GPU {gpu.id}: {gpu.load*100:.1f}% utilization")
```

## Expected Outcomes

### Short-term (1-2 weeks)
- Identify the primary bottleneck (likely time evolution)
- Achieve 2-3x speedup with 8 GPUs
- Reduce memory transfer overhead

### Medium-term (3-4 weeks)
- Implement advanced sharding strategies
- Achieve 4-5x speedup with 8 GPUs
- Optimize all major components

### Long-term (1-2 months)
- Achieve near-linear scaling (6-7x with 8 GPUs)
- Implement adaptive sharding based on problem size
- Create automated performance tuning

## Tools and Resources

### Profiling Tools

- **Custom profiler**: `benchmark/multi_gpu_profiling.py`

### Optimization Techniques
- **Sharding**: `jax.sharding` for data distribution

## Conclusion

The poor multi-GPU scaling in SuperGrad is likely due to a combination of:
1. Limited sharding strategy
2. Serial bottlenecks in time evolution
3. Memory transfer overhead
4. Suboptimal JIT compilation for multi-device

By following this systematic approach, you should be able to identify the specific bottlenecks in your workload and implement targeted optimizations to achieve the desired 4-5x speedup with 8 GPUs.

Start with the profiling script to get concrete data on where the bottlenecks are, then focus on the most impactful optimizations first.
